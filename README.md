# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

### Node.JS

To install and use this theme, It's required to be installed Node.js on your computer. Node is required only for run and deploy the application, we won't get into too much detail for the same. It' also not required to have detailed knowledge of Node.js

### Node/Yarn - Package Manager
This React project uses npm / yarn package manager to install and manage 3rd party components and libraries.

## Installation
1. First of all it's required to Install Node and npm / yarn.

2. You can clone this repo through : git clone https://github.com/Prem877/MoblileFirstTest.git or download zip file

3. Open your favorite console application (Terminal, iTerm, Command Prompt etc.). Navigate to the MobilFirstTest/folder and Install packages  : npm i, npm install or yarn install. This command will install all the required Node.js modules into the node_modules directory inside MobilFirstTest/folder. And now, you are ready to run the MobileFirstTest project for the first time.

4. To run project locally: npm start or yarn start This command will runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
